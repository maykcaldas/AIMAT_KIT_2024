Hello! I am Mayk Caldas and will be talking about machine learning foundations, how these concepts are used in chemistry, and the limitations and potential of data-driven approaches on the next CZS Summer School.
In addition, I will also briefly discuss a little about language models and how they impact in chemistry should be carefully taken into account when thinking about science for the next years.

This repository will be used to share content with you. Every material in this repository is open and can be adapted and used by you. And, of course, contributions are more then welcome!

I am looking forward to show you some cool research!
